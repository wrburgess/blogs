#Launch Early and Often

One of the biggest cost drains on application development projects is the constant tweaking, 

Changes before a product launches are bad for multiple reasons:

* Until your product hits beta and real, objective users, your changes are blind.
* Every change you make wastes previous hours spent on your app
* Every change made without user input risks being worthless

In the developer world, the craft has started using a technique called Continuous Integration. It does blah blah blah.

Likewise, the business side of of things should also take the Magical Launch Date and slice it up.

* Set up your features and changes for version 0.9, 1.0, 1.1
* Set up a Technical Launch Date (alpha), a Marketing Launch Date (beta), and a Stable Launch Date (stable)
* Don't set up any drop-dead launch date at all. When the MVP feature set is complete and things are secure, consider the product "launched"

Finally, if time equals money and changes cost time, it's time for you to start adding dollar signs to the tasks your developers are working on. Every time you submit a change request, treat the request as a reach into your pocket.
