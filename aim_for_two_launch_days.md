## Aim for Two Launch Days

Too often startups choose a single launch day to kick things off. As a result, development teams rush around with two goals in mind: Have all features done and bug-free and manage to scale the app for a slew of tire-kickers. This combination leads to a watering-down of both goals being met and raises the risk of more mistakes. 

Don't let this happen by aiming for two kinds of launches: Technical and Marketing. 

The Technical Launch Day is when you release your app to the public without any fanfare. Your developers focus on launching a working product, new features are locked, and bugs are quickly squashed.

The Marketing Launch Day is when you tell the whole world your product is ready to be used. Your public relations firm starts cranking and the advertising campaign kicks in. Your dev team is now focused on uptime and scaling and not much else.

The time between these two launches can be considerable, but the focus you afford your development team again reduces the risk of wasted time and considerable rework.
