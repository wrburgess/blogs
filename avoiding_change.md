# The Startup Development Process: The Cost of Change

One of the biggest problems I see in the startup development process is the introduction of pre-launch changes on a project which either deviate from the design, introduce new features, or considers new input from stakeholders outside of the previous process.

## Put Design Before Dev

The Agile movement has scared founders away from over-documention during the planning phase, but projects now seem to go to the other extreme: No design at all.

This is a bad trend if you want to save money on development. 

First, consider that designer time costs less than programmer time in today's labor market. Then, realize that every dev-hour spent without a design represents work completed via guesswork, estimation, and more meetings to make sure things seem correct.

Your goal as the client is to provide a roadmap for your developers to follow, reduce the amount of guesswork and clarification required to complete a task, and make the project blueprint where technical and non-technical team members can communicate ideas.

* Do invest in solid wireframes, mockups, and half-decent graphic design for what's being built.
* Don't pay your developers to fill the less-costly role of designers
* Don't let guesswork and estimation manage your project

## Fear Blind Change

Change will happen during the development phase, but there's a significant difference. 

What's 

Change costs more when it doesn't fix a problem or makes things worse, and the risk of incuring negative change is higher during the pre-launch phase. So why does every project get a list of Last-Minute Changes a week or so before launch? 

Because the feedback loop for your problem/solution increases tenfold when exposed to real users. 

The perfectionist side in us wants all features, to-dos, and bugs to be fixed before exposing our apps to the wild, but the truth is that the cost of pre-launch change is several times risker than post-launch change. The longer your app sits with the Dev Team, the longer it takes to reduce the cost of changes.

* Stage your application features for versions 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1.
* Treat blind changes like they're stealing from smart changes 
* Understand that change from user feedback is cheaper than changes from your gut

## Embrace Post-Launch Change

So how do you structure your budget to get a product launched while accounting
