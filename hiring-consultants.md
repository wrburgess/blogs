Hire a Consultant for Your Startup and Save Money

If you're a non-technical startup founder, you've probably heard the thinking that bootstrapping your app always costs less than using consultants. The truth, however, is that the biggest budget risks for your project, regardless of the development path you take, often lies in how both types of Dev Teams are managed.

After working in web/app development for twelve years, I've taken notes where projects start to go North cost-wise and what you, the non-technical founder, can do to keep costs down. If there's one theme you'll notice, it's that developer time is money and you're better off not wasting it. The key is to know what jobs you keep away from your devs.

* Put Design Before Dev
* Don't Be the Bottleneck
* Fear Change, Launch, Embrace Change
* Aim for Two Launch Days
* Focus on Foundation, Scaling Can Wait
* Leading Your Team Requires No Code

## Put Design Before Dev

The Agile movement has scared teams away from over-documented planning, but projects now seem to go to the other extreme: No design at all.

This is a bad trend. 

First, consider that designer time costs significantly less than programmer time in today's labor market. Then, realize that every developer hour spent without a design represents work completed via guesswork, estimation, and more meetings.

Your goal as the client is to provide a roadmap for your developers to follow, reduce the amount of guesswork and clarification required to complete a task, and make the project blueprint where technical and non-technical team members can communicate ideas.

* Do invest in solid wireframes, mockups, and half-decent graphic design for what's being built.
* Don't pay your developers to fill the less-costly role of designers
* Don't let guesswork and estimation manage your project

## Don't Be the Bottleneck

One of the biggest problems consultants have with clients is getting decisions out of them, but

As the founder or project manager, you're guaranteed to have a to-do list made of items that only you can answer. Since you are the boss or client, don't expect the folks working for you to hammer you for faster responses.

If your Dev Team asks you a question about requirements, makes a request for content examples, or asks you to clarify an issue, ramp up your urgency meter *immediately*. If you fail to reply quickly, your risk rises on developers waiting or incorrect work being done based on guesses. 

* Put a dollar signs next to each item on your Dev Team to-do list
* Be decisive when the Dev Team asks for your input. 
* Don't expect your developers to manage you. It's too risky for them to push your buttons.

## Fear Blind Change, Embrace Wise Change

Change will happen during the development phase, but you, the client, controls when it happens. Change costs more when it doesn't fix a problem or makes things worse, and the risk of incuring negative change is higher during the pre-launch phase. So why does every project get a list of Last-Minute Changes a week or so before launch? 

Because the feedback loop for your problem/solution increases tenfold when exposed to real users. 

The perfectionist side in us wants all features, to-dos, and bugs to be fixed before exposing our apps to the wild, but the truth is that the cost of pre-launch change is several times risker than post-launch change. The longer your app sits with the Dev Team, the longer it takes to reduce the cost of changes.

* Stage your application features for versions 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1.
* Treat blind changes like they're stealing from smart changes 
* Understand that change from user feedback is cheaper than changes from your gut

## Focus on Foundation, Scaling Can Wait

* change is inevitable, what you want is an app that can change without bringing down the entire system
* architecture should be focused on flexibility, not features
* scaling your app is a result of success and user interest, don't spend time on it unless you're certain 

## Leading Your Team Requires No Code

If you're a non-developer sitting around a crack team of devs gab about their IDEs, database schemas, Classic Inheritance, etc, I'm sure it can be intimidating, but knowing what your Dev Team does is not your job, it's theirs. Your job is to make sure time is spent wisely.
