#Suits vs Devs: Launch Day

Over a decade of straddling manager and developer roles, I've seen actors on both sides find a way to poke each other with sticks and make projects more difficult (and costly) than they need to be. 

This blog series, **Suits vs Devs**, will jump into issues facing application development and discuss the perspectives of the biz and tech folk as they approach these challenges. Everything from TPS Report Assignments to Coding Cowboys are game to be torn apart in future posts. 

*And, yes, I'm going to generalize the hell out of everybody.*

First up, I'm tackling the Drop-Dead-Everything-Is-Done-Launch-Day scenario.

## One Man's Launch Day is Another Man's 0.9.7 Release 
 
In Suit terms, Launch Day is a single calendar date when an app is released to the wild, followed by a newsletter push, a PR campaign, and eventually a big party in your local liquor district. The app has to be finished. Every newly thought-up feature and last-minute design change needs to be installed. The Dev Team and the Business Teams join together for several all-nighters leading up to the big day. Exhaustion is not a symptom of bad management, it's a side-effect of hard work.

Devs, however, work in a world where code is never complete, change is on-going, and the stress of focusing on a single, final day causes lower quality during the stretch run. As a result, Devs tend to follow the concept of multiple Release Dates, which are more like timestamps that reflect versioning (think 1.0, 2.5, and 3.4.7 tags) of the software pushed to production. Even when the product is launched, programming responsibilities still won't end for a while (or ever).

## Pressure Comes on Both Sides

Being that Suits have more power in setting up launch dates doesn't help the lack of love Devs have for the singular deadline. Often times, Devs feel launch dates are arbitrary and don't have much to do with the actual time constraints of the work. The Launch Day becomes more of a distraction for the application life cycle rather than a celebration of finished labor.

Despite thoughts to the contrary, the traditional Launch Day does have some reasoning behind it. Suits do have someone up the ladder, whether it's a boss or an investor, breathing down their necks to show where the budget funds are going. The dollars paying for development hours have to answer to something, at that's usually in the form of a launch date. Not to mention the other company arms (Sales, Marketing, etc) will need to ramp up support for the launch with deadlines of their own.

## Chop It Up

Meeting in the middle on Launch/Release scenarios isn't that hard, but it takes communication *before* the project starts. Both sides should recognize that a single, empowering release day is counter-productive to the software development process. Likewise, both parties should agree there is a justifiable need for milestones that have a hightened sense of urgency.

What I've found most successful is to extract the Suit-based Launch Date, break it up into three or four Dev-based Release Dates, then assign those new dates Suit and Dev-related nomenclature to keep both parties happy. 

It seems simplistic, but when both sides discuss feature expectations, change requests, and code stability around different release timelines, the added flexibility helps the scheduling issues a great deal. By the end of the project, the Suits are speaking in terms of Version numbers and Devs don't treat the Sales Launch with their typical disdain.

## Common Ground Found

Below is the Launch Timeline that was chosen for a project I managed a while back:

### Tech Launch (Version 0.8)

The Tech Launch represented the deadline for the Dev team. This date was more about feature-freeze (no new changes), bug-fixing, and code stability. The product was be considered "Live", but user access was restricted. The Suits didn't get to issue much input on this date because the Dev Team was more worried about function than form. Feature requests were pushed to future versions.

### User Launch (Version 0.9)

The User Launch was a deadline for both the Suits and Devs. The application was ready for user consumption, but the marketing efforts and promotion were still not allowed. The Devs focused on bug fixes almost exclusively and the Suits began their focus on feedback from bleeding-edge adopters. Feature changes were duly noted but still pushed out.

### Sales Launch (Version 1.0)

The Sales Launch was all about the Suits. Sales and Marketing was allowed to hammer the email lists, the PR folks were able to run free, and the [Slashdot Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect) would be a welcome result. The Suits were concerned with putting on a show, and the Dev team was focused on scaling, security, and bugs. Feature changes, you guessed it, were still kicked to the curb.

## No Hangover

After these three dates passed, user feedback and app traffic was processed and feature requests were accepted (or rejected) and prioritized. Because the Dev Team was not exhausted by the Single Date focus, there was very little time between the Sales Launch/Version 1.0 date and the subsequent feature changes being made. Version 1.1 and its change/feature set came within two weeks.

## The Endgame

While your projects will have their own set of political or budgetary constraints, a solution similar to the one above can go a long way to rid your projects of the Single Launch Day scenario that wears out your Devs and makes it harder to get things done *after* the application is released. At the same time, the Suits won't lose their target date to market the product, show off the investment, and get user feedback for the next round of changes.
